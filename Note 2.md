* When creating a virtual machine, install the operating system just like a regular computer. This means that the installation disc(s) for the operating system install on the virtual machine.  
* click to the new icon bar to start
* Identify the operating system. For example, if installing Windows 10, choose "Microsoft Windows" from the Type menu, and then "Windows 10" from the Version menu.
* Click next and set the RAM.
* Create a virtual hard drive. Make sure that the virtual hard drive has at least enough space to install the operating system. The most common format for virtual hard drives is VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image).
* Start the operating system installation. Install the operating system. 
* Boot up your virtual machine.
* Shut down your virtual machine.
* Take snapshots of your virtual machine.
